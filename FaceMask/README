install all the packages.

we have .ipynb file and .py files 

In .ipynb files we have trained our MobileNet V2 and saved our model and we used data set from the Kaggle.
Data set link is in Report.


we have few .py files. files 1_Dlib_CNN_FmCM_Camera.p, 2_OpenCV_DNN_FmCM_Camera.py, 3_HaarCascade_FmCM_Camera.py are for mask/nomask deection it can be executed using the 
"run python file button" or use this command in terminal "python file_Name"

the files 4_FacemaskImage_DNN.py, FaceMaskImage_Dlib_HoGLinearSVM.py are for mask/nomask detection on a image
so put the image you want to test in "testdata" folder and give the file name in the code example "frame = cv.imread('./testdata/1.jpeg')"
execute this files same as above files using run button or terminal 

there are few other files in the folder those are the saved models

I have added few output images in the output folder
